This is the installation file for the Davit package.

PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building Call Commander:

X11 Window System
Needed for building on Un*x-type systems, including Linux.  Virtually 
all Linux distros should include this.

Qt Toolkit, v3.2 or better
Most modern Linux distros include this.  It's typically installed as part
of the KDE Desktop Environment, although KDE is by no means required.
It can also be downloaded directly from TrollTech (ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/).

On Windows, you will need to purchase a Qt/Windows license from
TrollTech (http://www.trolltech.com/).

To enable a VNC login for Davit, add a section like the following to
'/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc':

[X-<X-display>-Core]
ServerCmd=/usr/bin/Xvnc
ServerVT=-1
ServerArgsLocal=-SecurityTypes=VncAuth -rfbauth=<path-to-vnc-passwd> -rfbport=<vnc-port>
AllowRootLogin=false
AllowShutdown=None
AutoLoginEnable=true
AutoLoginAgain=true
AutoLoginUser=<username>
AutoReLogin=true

See 'kdmrc-example' for a working example.
